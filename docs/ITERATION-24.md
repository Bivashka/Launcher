# Iteration 24: Masked Password Input in Launcher Login

Delivered:

- Updated launcher login UI to hide password characters while typing.
- Replaced plain password field behavior with masked input using `PasswordChar="*"`.
- Kept existing login flow and view-model contract unchanged (`PlayerPassword` binding remains).
- Verified launcher solution builds cleanly after UI change.
